* Introduction
**  Major hazard
Consequences
- Human
- Material
- Scientific
** Objective
- Identify risk
- Learn prevention procedures
- How to take action in case of fire
* What
** Uncontrolled Combustion
It needs:
- Fuel
- Oxidizing agent
- Activation energy
** The Fire Triangle
when one of them is removed the reaction stops
*** Fuel
- Solid
- Liquid
- Gaseous
*** Oxidizing agent
maintains the combustion of fuel
- Usually oxygen, but can be halogen sulphur phosphorus and others
*** Activation Energy
Triggers the combustion
- Source of heat (spark and others)
* What Can cause fire?
Main cause is electricity but there are others:
- Chemical (Reaction of flammable chemicals)
- Mechanical (friction)
- Thermal (naked flame)
- Natural (lightning, or fermentation)
** Electrical Equipment
- Overheating
- Tension Overload and etc
*** Prevention
- Never use equipment without a thermostat
- Watch the equipement
- Switch of at the end of use
- Never place next to fuel
- Avoid multi-sockets
- Don not use defective equipement
** Chemical
*Identify label!*
*Safety Data Sheet!*
- Limit quantity
- Work in ventilated area
- Keep away from ignition sources
- Inspect chemicals compatibility and stability before mixing
** Storage
should be adequate
Remove unused materials.
Ensure that combustible materials with high calorific potential are placed appropriately (archive room, store room, etc.).
Never use passageways for storage.
Ensure that flames or equipment that can cause a fire are used away from combustibles.
Never leave a burning flame unsupervised.
For hot work (outside the usual workspace), a hot work permit must be issued.
* Action
** Time
1min glass
2min bucket
3min truck
** What to do:
- Manual alarm
- *if minor*, try to extinguish
- evacuate
** Classes
- A Solids Wood Paper Cardboard
- B Liquids Alcohol Petrol Plastic
- C Gas
- D Metal
  For electrical fires use CO_2 or dry powder
  Use fire blankets in case of fire on a person
* Evacuation
- Evacuate calmly
- Close the doors (*do not lock*)
- *do not use lift*
- *do not go back*

  if not putting you in danger:
  - switch off equipment and experiments
  - switch off any ventilation
** Beware smoke
** Find a room with windows and seal bottom of the door
* THE END
    THE END
