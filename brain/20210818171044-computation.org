* Classes of Problems
- <<<decision problem>>> :: yes/no question
- $\mathcal{P}$ :: decision problem solved by deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time
- $\mathcal{NP}$ :: decision problem solved by non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time
- $\mathcal{NP}$ -hard :: at least as hard as a $\mathcal{NP}$ problem
- $\mathcal{NP} complete$ :: decision problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ and $\mathcal{NP}$ -hard at least as hard as a $\mathcal{NP}$ problem
