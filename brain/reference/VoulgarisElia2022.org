** CATALOG
*** Motivation
Uses matrix transfer functions model in an optimal control framework and shows that for some norm minimizations a decomposed optimization can be done without communication between agents.
*** Model
*** Remarks
*** Applications
*** Expressions
- To understand the relevance of θ in the optimal controller, we start considering simple cases in the next section.
*** References
** NOTES
*** each agent to exchange information with all the others agents.

*** In these MFG or MF settings, the results show that unless the average mass behavior is globally aggregated and available to each agent to be measured, the optimal controller is “centralized” and requires all the agents to be connected to each other in order to compute the mass average and use it in their control actions.

*** In particular, using our approach, we are able to show that every agent can totally discard its deviation from the average and solve its own selfish local minimization (hence decentralized),

*** By a decentralized and selfish solution, we mean that each agent can totally disregard its deviation from average, i.e., the social coupling, and perform an optimization of its own local regulated variables based on its own local measurements.
