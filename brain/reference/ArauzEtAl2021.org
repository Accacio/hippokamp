*** However, we find that schemes have been developed naively, presenting flaws and vulnerabilities that malicious entities can exploit to gain leverage in cyber-attacks.

*** Regarding the latter, three different security goals are often defined (Zeldovich, 2014): confidentiality, i.e., to maintain the secrecy of the important data, integrity, i.e., to guarantee the fidelity of the data, and availability, i.e., to ensure the accessibility of the data at the right time.
