*** Though this meter- hacking tutorial is about meters at the end consumers, it is conceivable that attackers have the same kind of ability to modify the meters in the power grid to introduce bad measurements if they have access to these meters.

*** Power systems researchers proposed to cal- culate the measurement residual z − Hx̂ (i.e., the diﬀerence between the vector of observed measurements and the vector of estimated measurements), and use its L 2 -norm z − Hx̂ to detect the presence of bad measurements. Speciﬁcally, z − Hx̂ is compared with a threshold τ , and the presence of bad measurements is assumed if z − Hx̂ > τ .
