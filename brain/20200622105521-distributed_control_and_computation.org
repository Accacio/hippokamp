$\theta_i(t+1)=\frac{1}{n_i(t)}\sum_{j\in N_i(t)} \theta_j(t)$
# TODO compact set subset, bounded and closed. all real values, normed space.
# closed complement of open set
# open set every point has a sufficiently close point

** Neighbor Graph $\mathbb{N}$
G=all directed graphs with vertex set v={1,2,\dots,n}
neighbor graphs = self-arced graphs
*** State Space Model
Use adjacency matrix
**** Flocking Matrix
$F_\N=D_\n^{-1} A\mathbb{N}^T$
$D_\n^{-1}=diagonal{d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n}$ = non-singular
$d_i=in-degree of vertex i=\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ji} > 0$
    $\theta(t+1)=F_\N(t)\theta(t)$
*** Induced Norms
$\|M\|_p$
$\|M_1M_2\|_p\leq \|M_1\|_p\|M_2\|_p$
$p=1,2, or \infty$
p=1 $\rightarrow max\limits_j\sum\limits_i|mij|$
p=2 $\sqrt{\mathrm{\text{largest eigenvalue of }}M^TM}$
p=\infty \rightarrow $max_i\sum_j|mij|$
*** Semi-norm
Semi-norm \rightarrow $|M|_p = min_{d\in\R^n} \|M-1d'\|_p$
- semi-contractive if $|M|_p<1$
- sub-multiplicative
** Laplacian Matrix
* Time Problems
<2020-06-22 lun.>
- asynchronyization different clocks unsynchronized
- delays
- bitrate constraints
* Asynchronous Systems
<2020-06-22 lun.>
- reorder
- use way-points
- expanded graph

* Distributed Averaging
<2020-06-23 mar.>
** Consensus and averaging
*** Consensus process
- Neighbor graph is an undirected connected graph
- x_i agreement variable
*** Averaging Process
- Consensus process with convergence to average of the initial values
- Application: Distributed temperature calculation
- Generalizations:
  - Time-varying (Changing Neighborhood)
  - Integer-values
  - Asynchronous
- Issues:
  - Robustness ?
  - How much information needed?
- Performance:
  - Convergence rate
  - # of transmissions needed
- General Approach:
  - Probabilistic
  - Deterministic
- Assumption:
  - $\mathbb{N}$ is a connected graph

** Linear iterations
- $x(t)\rightarrow \frac{1}{n}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}'x(0)=\mathbg{1}x_{\mathrm{avg}}$
- $\|S\|_{\infty} =1$

*** Laplacian of a simple undirected Graph
simple graph no self arcs
- Incidence matrix $Q_{n\times m}=[q_{is}$ of graph $\mathbb{G}$
  - s = 1 \rightarrow head
  - s =-1 \rightarrow tail
  - s = 0 \rightarrow not an edge

# graph laplacian
$L = D-A$
A = ajancency matrix of $\mathbb{N}$
D = diagonal with degrees
$x(t+1)=(I-\frac{1}{g}L)x((t)$
$g>max\{d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n\}$

(I-\frac{1}{g}L) doubly stochastic single eigenvalue at 1
**** Iterations
$x_i(t+1)=(1-\frac{d_i}{g})x_i(t)+\frac{1}{g}\sum\limits_{j\in\mathcal{N}_i}x_j(t)$
Metropolis Algorithm
** Gossiping
consensus process agent average its agreement variable with the agreement variable of *at most one of its neighbors*
- *spanning sub-graph* $\mathbb{M}$ of $\mathbb{N}$ = same vertices different edges
- Horn & Johnson matrix algebra

- algebraic
- group theory

*** *Perron Frobenius Theorem*
** Periodic gossiping
- repeated sequence of gossips
  order do not change convergence
- Brian Anderson
*** multi-gossip
more than one at a time (*still using one gossip per agent*)
chromatic index (minimum number of different colors of adjacent edges) is the minimal number of multi-gossips
*** Modified gossip rule
use $\alpha$ and $1-\alpha$ to average values
** multi-gossip sequences
- different sequences
use of singular values instead of eigen-values
** request based gossiping
chromatic number (minimum number of different colors of adjacent vertices)
*** protocol
** double linear iterations
#+begin_quote
very clever idea
#+end_quote
- Robin method
* Solving Linear Equations
<2020-06-24 mer.>
** Using consensus solve a linear equation
- m agents
  each agent have $(A_i^{n_i\times n}, b_i^{n_i\times 1})$
  neighbors change
  solve Ax=b
# Problem formulation before
*** connectivity
- graph strongly connected
- sequence of graphs is jointly strongly connected
- infinite sequence of graphs is repeatedly jointly strongly connected
*** algorithm
- use $P_i$ orthogonal projection on ker A_i
  $x_i(t+1)=x_i(t)-\frac{1}{m_i(t)}P_i(m_i(t)x_i(t)-\sum_{j\in \mathcal{N}_i(t)} x_j(t))$
- resilient $\rightarrow$ strongly connected even if some nodes are lost
- lemma in pag 23 $\rightarrow$ distributed state estimator
