* System Identification: data-based modeling
<2021-04-06 mar. 14:00-15:00>

** Dynamical systems
** Data-based modeling
*** DC motor
- Input :: Applied voltage [V]
- Output ::  measured rotation speed [rad/s]
**** Collect data
**** Model
- Model :: Discrete Time Transfer Function
  Collected data has been created by "computer"
  - ZOH + Continuous System + Sampling
- Motor is linear?? Not??
- Find model that reduces $\epsilon(t)=y(t)-\hat y(t)$
*** Why it is useful?
- First-principle modeling = modeling using the laws of physics
**** Example 1: Track Tracking in a Cd Player
- Arm is supposed rigid -> model is a second order integrator
- first-principle doesn't work sometimes (error on hypothesis)
**** [#A] Example 2: Signal equalization in mobile telephony
- First-principle is almost impossible (mobile moves, different environments)
- Received signal is made up from several delayed versions of the input signal (reflexions and refractions)
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter][Wiener filter]]
***** Use of a known sequence
- Training sequence is sent before the signal of interest, so channel can be estimated ( mobile can be moving )
- FIR order 6
*** Players in system [[file:20210323094314-identification.org][Identification]]
- Input $u(t)$ (freely chosen)
- Ouput $y(t)$ (can be measured)
  + Contribution due to $u(t)$ :: $u(t)$ $G_Ou(t)$
  + Contribution independent of $u(t)$ :: disturbance $v(t)$
*** Identification procedure
