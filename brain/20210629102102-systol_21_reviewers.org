* Comments
** Comments to author (Associate Editor)
=====================================
Both reviewers consider the paper interesting but mention
several issues: unclear notation; a simulation which is not
necessarily realistic; insufficiently characterized nature
of the attack.

Comments to the author
======================

This paper discusses how to mitigate the effects of an
uncooperative agent in a distributed model predictive
control system, and illustrates the application of this
approach on a temperature controller for multiple rooms.

An uncooperative agent can modify its local cost (via
lagrangian multiplier) which then affects the coordinator's
resource allocation to other agents.

The proposed approach re-constructs the langrangian
multiplier, which represents importance of local cost, from
the resource variables, thus bypassing a corrupt agent.

Robustness of experiments.
Were the experiments repeated with different environmental
and model parameters to establish the veracity of results?
Given the experiments, it is not evident how sensitive this
mechanism is to different attack magnitudes. In section V
the severity of the selfish agent is also not documented,
so it is not apparent if the simulation is realistic.

Presentation.
The terms for formulae were sometimes left undocumented:

    \Lambda on page 3. Is it a stacked version of \lambda
lagrangian multipliers?
    \Gamma in equation 2. It may be part of standard MPC
terminology, but is not described in the paper.
    Q, R in problem 1. In fact more common terms like x,
u, t, and w are not defined when they are first introduced
and have to be inferred. In come cases it was easy to infer
due to their common usage in literature. In other cases, it
was not.
    An intuitive understanding or description of P_i(k),
H_i, s_i(k), and f in equations 8,9,10 would help
comprehension and accessibility.

Comments to the author
======================

The following comments may be considered for improving the
quality of the manuscript.

Pg1. 2nd paragraph under section introduction: should it be
"Furthermore, distributed model predictive control (DMPC)"
instead of "Furthermore, distributed predictive control
(DMPC)"

Pg1. 2nd paragraph under section introduction: It is not
clear what the author is trying to convey in the sentence
"These strategies thus reduce the computing burden while
increasing confidentiality."

Pg1 col2: Typo in " Moreover, In Section V" needs to
corrected.

in Eq (2): $\Gamma_i$ is not defined.

Pg3 col2 ln1 : it is not clear what $Lambda$ denotes and
what its contents are

Pg4 Assumption 1:  $P_i$ is a constant matrix, why is the
estimate of $P_i$ given by $\hat{\tilde{P}}_i(k)$ obtained
and compared for two different times. wouldn't it suffice
if the estimate is obtained and compared with the actual
$P_i$ matrix.

Pg4 Assumption 3: when comparing eq(10) and eq(13),
shouldn't it be $\hat{\tilde{P}}_i$ and
$\hat{\tilde{s}}_i(k)$
$T_i(k)$
It is not clear how the authors have derived the eq(14)
- modelo ataque $\tilde{P}=TP$

Table I: The cost for each room is different even though
each room is identical, perhaps illustrating the building
layout might help in visualizing the interaction that can
justify the cost.
