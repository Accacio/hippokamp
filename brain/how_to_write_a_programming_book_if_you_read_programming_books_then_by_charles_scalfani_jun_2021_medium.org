Here are some of my most important teaching rules:
1. Always start where the student is an expert.
2. Take the student from where they are to where you want to take them one micro-baby step at a time for the whole trip explaining yourself before each and every step while never skipping a single step or leaving anything out.
3. Never give a student a solution to a problem they don’t have.
4. Simulate discovery whenever possible.
  Concrete models are far more powerful than Abstract ones.
