#+begin_quote
Two lessons can be drawn from Example 4.1.2. First, the model and the
observation co-ordinates should be chosen to avoid approaching linear dependence
between the regressors. Second, the sensitivity of the model coefficient
estimates to noise may be much higher than that of the goodness of fit. The
importance of avoiding high sensitivity varies according to whether interest
centres on the accuracy of the coefficients or their ability to fit the
observations.
