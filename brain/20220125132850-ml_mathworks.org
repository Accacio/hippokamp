#+title: ML Mathworks Seminar
- presenter :: Lama Itani

* How to predict future electricity demand?
** Overview load forecasting
- distributed Producers and consumers
- scattered generation \to power flows everywhere
- behavior: unpredictable \to grid analytics
** Application areas of grid analytics
*** Asset management
  - predictive maintenance
*** Grid stability
  - achieve a balanced production
*** Load/price forecasting
  - DL algorithms to predict load and price
** Load forecasting
- very short-term :: ~ 1h
*** Methods
1. Understand problem
2. data available
3. explore data
4. make predicitons
*** Model
**** Univariate model
***** con
- SISO
**** Multivariate model
***** con
- Requires tons of high quality data
**** AI Models

** AI Models
**** Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- Machine learning while Deep learning is extracted by itself
***** cons
- Runtime
- over/underfitting

**** workflow
- Access and load the data
- Preprocess the data
- Engineer / Extract features
- Develop a predictive model
- integrate model into the system
