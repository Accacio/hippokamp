* Use Textual Format
- Serialize Entities
  Take care with floating points
- Save serialized entities in different files
- use Version Control

* Naming Files
#+begin_quote
My solution was a somewhat lazy one: we allocate a range of IDs to each computer that edits the world. These are kept in a file called "id_ranges"; at startup time, the game queries its machine's MAC address, then looks in the file for the corresponding ID range; if not found, it claims a new range and adds a new line to the file:
#+end_quote

* Logistical problems

** Arrays
How much memory to allocate?
