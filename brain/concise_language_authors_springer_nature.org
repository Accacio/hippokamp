* Tips for concise language

** Guidelines
- One Idea per Sentence
- Active Voice
- Delete Unnecessary or vague words
** Subject and verb placement
Verb should be near the subject.
** Topic position
The Beginning of a sentence should
1. Present the topic of the sentence
2. Serve as a Link to previous topic
** Comparisons
*** Only compare similar things
_Good: The brain activity in Patient A was compared with that of Patient B._
+Bad: The brain activity in Patient A was compared with Patient B.+

_Good: Expression levels of p53 in smokers were compared with p53 levels in non-smokers._
*Better: Expression levels of p53 in smokers were compared with those in non-smokers.*
*OBS:* Avoid repetition
*** Avoid being vague (Always compare something with something else)
Good: Reactions with the new machine were faster than those with the old machine.

Bad: Reactions with the new machine were faster.

The second sentence makes the reader wonder “Faster than what?”
*** Use only "Reduced", "increased" and "decreased" to compare something to the way it was before
To compare different things use "higher", "shorter", "more"
** Proper Nouns
    Capitalize Proper Nouns
** Articles
- "a" before consonants, "an" before vowel sounds
- Use "the" when the thing discussed was already mentioned
