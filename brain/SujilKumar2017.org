** CATALOG

*** Motivation :springGreen:
Multi-agent based system simulated in the presence of different events
*** Model :lightSkyblue:
Multi agents that exchange information among them
- Short-term Renewable energy source forecast
- Short-term State of the charge of batteries
- Short-term Load Forecast
- Control Center
*** Remarks
Disturbances are :
- another asynchronous machine added
- Shading effect in PV farm
- Exceeding speed in wind turbine
*** Applications
*** Expressions
*** References :violet:
