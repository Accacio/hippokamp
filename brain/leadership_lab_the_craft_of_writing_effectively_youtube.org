- Organized
- Clear
** Writing is not conveying your ideas but change the readers idea
#+begin_quote
Nobody cares what ideas you have
#+end_quote
- Don't begin with definitions
* Bad things to say
- _Important_ $\neq$ _Knowledge_
- _New_ $\neq$ _Knowledge_
- _Original_ $\neq$ _Knowledge_

** Nobody cares if not valuable
** Unfortunately knowledge does not increase linearly with experiences
- value is given by academia
  Big problem, but they do
  #+begin_quote
Too Male, Too Pale, Too Stale
  #+end_quote
  - Good news -> they are changing, slowly but they are
* Write to help yourself thinking
* "Value Words"
- Communities usually have a 'dialect', a code
- some words are used to demonstrate value

** Know your community
- 15 minutes a week circle "value words" in articles
  #+begin_quote
  Know the codes of the community you are entering in.
  #+end_quote
- Make a Word List for different communities
  Note words, if you do not find those words in your writings, sprinkle some of them

  #+begin_quote
  Persuasion depends on what they doubt. If you don't know what they doubt how on
  earth are you going to overcome those doubts? You must know them (the readers).
  It is not enough to know your subject matter. You've got to know your readers.
  #+end_quote  35:08

** Types of words
- Words that have something to do with the community
  Ex.: widely, accepted, reported
- Flow Words | Transition Words
  Ex.: nonetheless, however, although

* Do not explain, argue
#+begin_quote
Predict what they are going to doubt when you say they are wrong
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
The function of your writing is to move this conversation forward, it cannot do
that in your desk drawer. The function is to move a conversation forward is not
to present indefinitely.

    - Instability
    - Cost/Benefits
      The instability creates cost to the readers
      The solution brings benefits to the readers
