- «ordinances» and «edicts of the king»
- Parliamentary decisions
- Canon law \to Church
** Sources of contemporary Law

** National Sources
The Law and regulations
- The Law is the body of rules approved by a vote in Parliament

- decrees and orders concerning individual matters are note deemed to fall under the rule of law
** Respective fields of law and regulations
- Parliament (the law):
  - «personal status»
  - fundamental principles
- Executive branch
  + all rules not subordinate to a law
  + exceptions [[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/article_lc/LEGIARTI000019241024/][articles 38]] and [[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/article_lc/LEGIARTI000019241008/][16 constitution]]
** Drafting of a law
*** Drafting of a law
- Prime Minister and members of Parliament
- Verification of the law's compliance
  + constitutionality by the constitutional council
  + preliminary ruling on constitutionality
- Review of the legality of the regulation
  - =A posteriori=
    - «voie d'action», way of an action
      - Citizen has legitimate interest and goes to the judge
    - «voie d'exception», way of plea,
      - Citizen defends yourself (regulation is still applied to other people)
- Repeal of laws and regulations
  - A time limit is rarely mentioned
  - In principle, the text must be repealed, expressly or tacitly
    + expressly :: the law is repealed
    + tacitly :: new law contradicts older
  - The laws and regulations cannot fall into abeyance
*** Case Law or Judicial precedence
- The Judge is meant to enforce the law
- Judicil precendence creates the law when:
  - the wording of the law is unclear, imprecise, ambiguous or obscure
  - a new and unpredicted situation occurs, for example: road accidents

Do judges create the rule of law?
Two different rules:

#+begin_quote
La signature nécessaire à la perfection d'un acte juridique identifie celui qui l'appose. Elle manifeste le consentement des parties aux obligations qui découlent de cet acte. Quand elle est apposée par un officier public, elle confère l'authenticité à l'acte.

Lorsqu'elle est électronique, elle consiste en l'usage d'un procédé fiable d'identification garantissant son lien avec l'acte auquel elle s'attache. La fiabilité de ce procédé est présumée, jusqu'à preuve contraire, lorsque la signature électronique est créée, l'identité du signataire assurée et l'intégrité de l'acte garantie, dans des conditions fixées par décret en Conseil d'Etat.
